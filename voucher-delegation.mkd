--- abstract

This document describes an extension of the RFC8366 Voucher Artifact
in order to support delegation of signing authority.  The initial voucher
pins a public identity, and that public indentity can then issue additional
vouchers.  This chain of authorization can support permission-less resale
of devices, as well as guarding against business failure of the
BRSKI {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).

# Introduction

The {{RFC8366}} voucher artifact provides a proof from a manufacturer's
authorizing signing authority (MASA) of the intended owner of a device.  This is
used by an onboarding Pledge device in BRSKI ({{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}},
{{I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher}}), and SZTP ({{RFC8572}}).

There are a number of criticisms of the MASA concept.  They include:

* the MASA must be reachable to the Registar during the onboarding process.

* while the use of a nonceless voucher (see {{RFC8366} section 4) can
  permit the MASA to be offline, it still requires the public key/certificate
  of the Registrar to be known at issuing time

* the MASA must also approve all transfers of ownership, impacting the rights of the initial seller to transfer ownership as they see fit.

* if the Registrar has any nonceless vouchers, then it can not change it's public key, nor can it change which certification authority it uses

* it is not possible for a MASA to pin ownership to a Registrar by Certification Authority plus DN

* the creator of an assembly of parts/components can speak for the entire
  assembly of parts in a transparent way

## Requirements for the delegation {#requirements}

This voucher artifact satisfies the following requirements:

### Disconnected or Offline MASA

A Registrar wishes to onboard devices while not being connected to the
Internet.

### Resale of devices

An owner of a device wishes to resale devices which have previously been
onboarded to a third party without specific authorization from the
manufacturer.

### Crypto-agility for Registrar

The owner/manager of a registrar wishes to be able to replace its domain
registration key.
Replacing the registration key would invalidate any previously acquired
(nonceless) vouchers.
Any devices which have not been onboarded, or which need to be factory reset,
would not trust a replacement key.

### Transparent Assemblers/Value-Added-Resellers

An assembly may consist of a number of parts which are onboarded to a local
controller during the manufacturing process.
Subsequent to this, the entire assembly will be shipped to a customer who
wishes to onboard all the components.
The sub-components of the assembly needs to communicate with other
sub-components, and so all the parts need to transparently onboarded.
(This is contrasted with an assembly where the controller acts as a security
gateway. Such a gateway might be a single point of failure)

Assemblies may nest quite deeply.

## Overview of proposed solution

The MASA will issue a voucher that delegates it's signing authority for one
or more devices to a specific Registrar.
This is called a "delegation voucher".

This Registrar can then operate as an authorized signing authority for the
manufacturer, and can subsequently issue additional vouchers binding the
pledge to new Registrars.

This delegation can potentially be repeated multiple times to enable second,
third, or n-th level of resale.

The delegation voucher may be stored by the pledge for storage, to be
included by the pledge in subsequent bootstrap operations.
The inclusion of the delegation permits next Registrars with heuristics that
permit it to find the delegated authorized signing service (DASA).

The delegation voucher pins the identity of the delegated authority using a
variety of different mechanisms which are covered in {{pinnedmechanism}}.

# Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

Delegated Authorized Signing Authority :
: the Delegated Authorized Signing Authority (DASA) is a service that can
generate vouchers for one or more pledges to provide bootstrap authority
separate from the manufacturer.

Delegation Voucher:
: a Delegation Voucher is an {{RFC8366}} format voucher that has additional
fields to provide detailed the entity to which authority has been delegated.

Intermediate Voucher:
: a voucher that is not the final voucher linking a pledge to its owner.

End Voucher:
: a voucher that is the final voucher linking a pledge to its owner.

# Delegated Voucher artifact

The following tree diagram shows the extensions to the {{RFC8366}} voucher.

There are a few new fields: pinned-delegation-certificate-authority,
pinned-delegation-name, delegation-count.  In addition, the serial-number
field is no longer a plain leaf, but can also be an array.

INSERT_FIG_FROM_FILE ietf-delegated-voucher-tree.txt END

## YANG module

This module uses the grouping that was created in {{RFC8366}} to extend the
definition.

INSERT_FIG_FROM_FILE ietf-delegated-voucher@DATE.yang END

## Bundling of the vouchers

The {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} defines a mechanism to return a
single voucher to the pledge.

This protocol requires a number of additional items to be returned to the
pledge for evaluation:  the series of Intermediate Vouchers that leads to the
DASA, and the public keys (often as certificates) of the Registrars on the
Delegation Path that leads to each Authority.

## Delegation of multiple devices

A MASA MAY delegate multiple devices to the same Registrar by putting an
array of items in the "serial-number" attributes. (XXX-how to describe this
in the YANG)

# Enhanced Pledge behaviour

The use of a delegated voucher requires changes to how the pledge evaluates
the voucher that is returned to by the Registrar.

There are no significant changes to the voucher-request that is made.
The pledge continues to pin the identity of the Registrar to which it is
connected, providing a nonce to establish freshness.

A pledge which has previously stored a delegation voucher and delegated
authority, SHOULD include it in its voucher request.
This will be in the form of a certificate provided by the "previous" owner.
This allows the Registrar to discover the previous authority for the pledge.
As the pledge has no idea if it connecting to an entity that it previously
has connected to, it needs to include this certificate anyway.

The pledge receives a voucher from the Registrar.
This voucher is called the zero voucher.
It will observe that the voucher is not signed with its built-in manufacturer
trust anchor and it can not verify it.

The pledge will examine the voucher to look for the "delegation-voucher"
and the intermediate-identities attributes within the voucher.
A certificate from the set of intermediate-identities is expected to validate
the signature on this zeroth end-entity voucher.
(XXX- This attribute can be replaced by the CMS certificate chain)

The contained delegation-voucher object is to be interpreted as an
(intermediate) voucher.
This first voucher is called the first voucher, or "voucher[1]".
Generically, for voucher[i], the voucher found in the delegation-voucher is
called voucher[i+1].

If voucher[i] can be validated by a built-in trust anchor, then the process
is done.
If not, then voucher[i] is examined in a recursive process until no there are
no further embedded vouchers.
The last voucher[n] is expected to be validated by a built-in manufacturer
trust anchor.

Once the top (n-th) voucher is found, then the pinned-certificate-authority
is added to the working set of trust anchors.
The pinned-certificate-name attribute is used along with the trust anchor to
validate the certificate chain provided with the n-1th voucher.
This is repeated (unwinding the recursive processing) until the zeroth
voucher has been validated.

# Changes to Registrar behaviour

TBD

## Discoverying the most recent Delegated Authority to use

The pledge continues to use its manufacturer issued IDevID when performing
BRSKI-style onboarding.
The IDevID contains an extension, the MASA URL (see
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} section 2.3.2).
The IDevID certificate is not expected to be updated when the device is
resold, nor may it be practical for an intermediate owner to be able
to replace the IDevID with their own.
(Some devices may support having an intermediate owner replace the IDevID, in
which case this section does not apply)

The Registrar needs to be informed that it should not contact a MASA using
the URL in the IDevID, but rather to contact the previous owner's DASA.

This can be accomplished by local override, as described in
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} section 5.4:

    Registrars MAY include a mechanism to override
    the MASA URL on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis, and within that
    override it is appropriate to provide alternate anchors.  This will
    typically used by some vendors to establish explicit (or private)
    trust anchors for validating their MASA that is part of a sales
    channel integration.

The above override needs to be established on a per-device basis.
It requires per-device configuration which is very much non-autonomic.

There are two other alternatives:

1. The Manufacturer could be aware of any delegation-vouchers that it has
   issued for a particular device, and when contacted by the Registrar, it
   could redirect the Registrar to the DASA.

2. The Pledge could provide a signed statement from the manufacturer
   providing the Registrar with a pointer to the DASA.

Option 1 requires that the Registrar still contact the MASA, violating most
of the goals from {{requirements}}.

Option 2 requires a signed artifact, and conveniently, the delegation voucher
is exactly the document needed.
The most difficult problem is that the Pledge needs to (a) store one or more
delegation vouchers in a non-volatile storage that survives factory reset
operations, (b) attach these documents to the pledge's voucher-request.

The extension to the {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}}
voucher-request described below provides for a contained for these delegation vouchers.

## YANG Module Security Considerations

As described in the Security Considerations section of {{RFC8366}} (section 7.4), the YANG module specified
in this document defines the schema for data that is subsequently
encapsulated by a CMS signed-data content type, as described in Section 5 of
{{RFC5652}}. As such, all of the YANG modeled data is protected from modification.

The use of YANG to define data structures, via the 'yang-data'
statement, is relatively new and distinct from the traditional use
of YANG to define an API accessed by network management protocols
such as NETCONF {{RFC6241}} and RESTCONF {{RFC8040}}.
For this reason, these guidelines do not follow template described by
Section 3.7 of {{RFC8407}}.
